# Attendance-Record
This is a python code made with pandas library. Basically  its keeps record of the attendees in a particular institution/offices or etc.

## what it does?

This code contains a function called marker() which takes input a location of a file (csv file), then it checks the amount of people present/absent in the file.
Then writes the present students & absents students in a txt file and saves it in the default folder.
## Advantage of the code ?
The code help teachers alot to keep an eye on  students wheter they are attending the class or not attending the class :P.
